So. Wow. Just got out of Marching Powder and I honestly don’t know where to start with this whole brain-jumble of mine. First off, let’s clear something up — you don’t walk into this   expecting a cozy night with popcorn and predictable laughs. Nah, it’s more like diving headfirst into a too-tight rollercoaster ride, not knowing if you’ll puke or scream or maybe both.

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s based on that crazy book which I guess is cool, but who needs sleepy bedtime stories when you can have... this mad journey. One moment I’m wide-eyed with curiosity, the next I’m groaning because it all just feels a touch too real, like when your uncle overshares at Thanksgiving dinner. Bolivia’s got colors and chaos—they nailed that part, the sort that hits you in the gut and leaves a questionable aftertaste but in a weirdo way you can’t quite dismiss.

>Here’s the kicker - was I rooting for Thomas or despising him? There’s your mystery meat of emotions right there. One moment he's in the middle of this ludicrously vibrant, near psychedelic prison world and I'm thinking, “Dude, how’d your life end up there?” Then I catch a wisp of empathy just as he does something completely human and stupid. You feel?

There's also this point where you realize you’re slightly tired—like emotional jet lag—but you keep going because you need to know what happens next. It's not a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. It’s a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 you survive. In the best, mind-bogglingly baffling way possible. Ugh, there's a certain charm in confusing the hell out of myself.

Here's a hot mess in code for those weird enough to enjoy it: `print(Escaping reality, but never the memories of San Pedro)`.

All in all, it was like slipping on a stray banana peel, whirling through wild frames of life’s absurd reality. Whether you decide to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   or go rogue and 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it somewhere (not condoning piracy, hey, just saying), it’s a ride. And I'll still be reeling tomorrow with a smile that says, ‘I survived Marching Powder.’
